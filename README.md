This extension leverages WebGPU to efficiently process AI models directly in the browser. The summarization model is cached for enhanced performance, reducing load times and improving user experience during consecutive uses.

The underlying AI technology is powered by [web-llm](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/tree/main), an open-source project that allows machine learning inference using WebGPU.
